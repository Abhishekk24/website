          <h2>WHAT NETSEPIO DOES?</h2>
         
          <p>NetSepio browser extension allows users to vote for a website/domain categorizing it into various categories and 
            get rewards. The user can be aware of the threats like Tracking, Malware, Drive-By Downloads, Adware, Phishing,
            Cryptojacking, etc. and also can report the website for having unsafe content. The report/voting process happens 
            over a Blockchain based Smart Contract which gives rewards to users for every vote submitted. This enables users 
            to pre-emptively protect their online activities from advanced threats in a collaborative way with a decentralized 
            and tamperproof process using blockchain technology. We aim to create a security & privacy focused framework for online 
            activities & Pseudo-anonymous Reputation based systems for online interactions.</p>
           <p> 1. Tracking Alert: A large number of people are getting connected to the internet everyday and are unaware of the information 
            being collected about them.<br>
            2. Detect Malware Infected Website: Malware is software designed to infect your computer without your knowledge. This happens 
            over a website that attempts to install software onto the device. Malware is most often used to steal personal information, 
            send junk email (spam), or spread more malware. <br>

          <P>3. Prevent by Detecting Drive-By Downloads: n a Drive-By Download attack, cybercriminals compromise a website, often a legitimate 
            one, by embedding or injecting malicious objects inside the web pages. These can be installed on your computer simply by looking 
            at an email, browsing a website or clicking on a pop-up window with text designed to mislead you, such as a false error message.<br>
            4. Adware Alert: Adware is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser. 
            These are modern day PUAs (Potentially Unwanted Applications) which causes redirects, gather data, and deliver various intrusive 
            advertisements without your consent.<br>
            5. Detect Phishing Website: Phishing is an attempt to gather sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details 
            from users by fraudulent means. Phishing emails and websites often tell a story to trick you into clicking on a link or opening an attachment.<br>
            6. Prevent by Detecting Cryptojacking: Cryptojacking (also called malicious crypto mining) is an emerging online threat that hides on a computer 
            or mobile device and uses the machineâ€™s resources to mine cryptocurrencies.</p>
